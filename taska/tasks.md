Hello Jane,

Thanks for reaching out. We appreciate your interest in the CodePath course.

We are planning to expand to many more areas as well.

If you sign up for our [mailing list](https://www.codepath.org/courses/waitlist?hsLang=en), we’ll notify you as classes become available in your area powered by local organizers or through remote means.

We hope to be able to bring programs to your area soon and expand our audience for future programs.
